A two dimesional tool for simulating the dynamics of a fluid/fluid interface in low Reynolds flow.

\subsection*{Quickstart}

After downloading the source files, use 
\begin{DoxyCode}
make shearDrop\_exe
\end{DoxyCode}
 to build all source files and an example problem. The example problem can be executed by 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./shearDrop\_exe <Nx> <Ny>
\end{DoxyCode}
 where {\itshape Nx}, {\itshape Ny} are the number of grid points to use in the {\itshape x} and {\itshape y} directions, respectively. On the first run, the user will be prompted to create a parameter file specifying the initial position/radius of the drop. Answer {\ttfamily y} and input drop position/radius. Note that the default domain size is {\ttfamily \mbox{[}-\/1,1\mbox{]}x\mbox{[}-\/1,1\mbox{]}}.
