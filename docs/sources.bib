	abstract = {The level set method [8] has become a widely used numerical method for moving interfaces, e.g. see the many examples in [11, 7]. For many applications, the velocity of the interface is known only on the interface, while the level set method requires information about the interface speed at least in a neighborhood of grid points near the interface. To address this issue, velocity extensions are used to map the velocity information on the interface into the rest of the computational domain [2]. This allows the level set method to proceed.},

	abstract = {A new iterative method is presented for solving finite difference equations which approximate the steady Stokes equations. The method is an extension of successive-over-relaxation and has two iteration parameters. Perturbation methods are used to analyze the iteration matrix. Sufficient conditions for the convergence of the iterative method are obtained and it is shown that many reasonable finite difference schemes for the Stokes equations satisfy these conditions. Computational examples are given to show the efficiency of the method.},

	abstract = {The flow pattern of blood in the heart is intimately connected with the performance of the heart valves. This paper extends previous work on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of moving immersed boundaries which interact with the fluid. The boundary representation now includes the muscular heart wall. The fixed topology of the boundary representation is exploited in the solution of the nonlinear equations which implicitly define the boundary forces. An improved numerical representation of the ÎŽ-function is introduced. A fast Laplace-solver is used. The results of calculations with a natural valve and with a prosthetic valve are presented.},
